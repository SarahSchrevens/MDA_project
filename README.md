# MDA Exam Project

This project is done for the assignment project of Modern Data Analytics in academic year 2022-2023.

All files used for all phases of the project can be found here.

Beyond installing packages in requirements.txt, front-end testing of weather data scraping requires installation of Selenium and Chromedriver for Chrome. Specific instructions can be found in the appendix.

We use AWS by the way! We don't have a billing alarm and we are not mining crypto.
