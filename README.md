# MDA Exam Project

This project is done for the assignment project of Modern Data Analytics in academic year 2022-2023.

All files used for all phases of the project can be found here. Files that are not used for the final iteration of the application can be seen in the "archive" subdirectory.

The "AWS" folder specifically refers to files used and stored in AWS, linked to the application.
The "Scraping" folder refers to all scripts used to scrape relevant data used in the application from multiple sources, ie. Het Depot, LOKO, Belgian schools, and Wunderground.
The "dash" folder contains the scripts used for constructing the application itself.
The "meteo_data_preprocessing" folder has Jupyter Notebooks on the preprocessing steps used for the weather data given for the project.

Beyond installing packages in requirements.txt, front-end testing of weather data scraping requires installation of Selenium and Chromedriver for Chrome. Specific instructions can be found in the appendix.
